/*
!LOOPS
Loops allow us to go over a block of information or code in a determined amount of cycles. It's important to note that it is possible for us to write code without declaring an endpoint.

Loops help us repeat a process without rewriting a lot of code.

/*
! FOR LOOPS

*Structure

We have to setup our loops in a way that we can 1) See where we are in a loop, 2) Consider what sort of Condition we want to run it against, and 3) Note when we are done with that condition and move on to the next iteration.

    We need to:
    1) Create an Index
    2) Run a condition
    3) Change to the indexing variable (execution of the condition)
*/

//? Let's count to 10:

for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  /*
  We state our loop with a "for". Within this function, we are injecting some parameters that JS will run against. index; condition; change index -> result.
  
  Within our parameters, we are stating an index declaration to 0. This is baseline. We move on asking if that variable is less than or equal to the number 10, take that set number and add 1 to it's value. Once that is processed, return that value (in this case a console.log of that number). Once our condition is met, we return a FALSE which ends our loop. THIS is important to note:
  
  for(<create index variable>; <run condition>; <change index>) {
      <return results>
      <continue until condition is met>
  }
  */
  
  //? If we do not indicate what our condition is, the loop will not have a finish and thus runs until we have to force close it.
  
  /*
  INFINITE LOOP
   for(let i = 0; i++){   i = i + 1
       console.log(i);
   }
  */
  
  //No condition means that JS doesn't know when to stop and will never assume that information.
  
  //! CHALLENGE:
  //* Using a for loop, set an index to 2.  Make a condition where if that number is greater than -10, change that index by subtracting 4 and console log each iteration.  2:10p
  
  for (let i = 2; i > -10; i -= 4) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  
  //? We aren't limited by positive or negative numbers. We even cycle through variables assigned with strings.
  
  let word = "supercalifragilisticecpialidocious";
  
  for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
    //? .length is a method that we can use in JS that helps us determine a value that we may not know.
    console.log(i, word[i]);
    //1) We set a value of each index and are displaying that.
    //2) We set to display the value within the "object" of word. Each character that is assigned to the variable of "word" is provided an index value and this is how we are cycling through it.
    console.log(`The letter ${word[i]} is in position: ${i}`);
